# UCLouvain-Course-Scraper

Scraper for UCLouvain courses.

## Description

This repo provides a Python script to scrape course information from the UCLouvain (Universit√© catholique de Louvain) course catalog. It allows you to retrieve detailed information about courses, filter them based on various criteria, and save the data into JSON files for further analysis.

## Features

- **Scrape course information** from UCLouvain's online course catalog.
- **Retrieve detailed course data** such as title, credits, quadrimester, teachers, and more.
- **Filter courses** based on credits, quadrimester, included keywords, and excluded keywords.
- **Save scraped data** into JSON files to avoid redundant scraping.
- **Output filtered courses** to the console and save them into a separate JSON file.

## Example

Suppose you are interested in scraping all courses in quadrimester 1 (`Q1`) that have between 2 and 6 credits.

### Set the `filter_params` as follows:

```python
filter_params = {
    'min_credits': 2,
    'max_credits': 6,
    'quadrimester': ['Q1'],
    'include_keywords': None,
    'exclude_keywords': None
}
```

### Run the script
```bash
python scraper.py
```

### Sample Output

```vbnet
Scraping UCLouvain course information...
Data folder 'master_courses_24_25' exists. Loading data from JSON files...
10222 courses loaded.

```

## Custom Filtering

You can customize the filters to include or exclude courses based on specific keywords in different sections.

### Include Keywords Example
To include only courses that mention **"machine learning"** in any section:

```python
filter_params = {
    'min_credits': None,
    'max_credits': None,
    'quadrimester': None,
    'include_keywords': {'global': ['machine learning']},
    'exclude_keywords': None
}
```

### Exclude Keywords Example
To exclude courses that mention "statistics" in the content section:

```python
filter_params = {
    'min_credits': None,
    'max_credits': None,
    'quadrimester': None,
    'include_keywords': None,
    'exclude_keywords': {'content': ['statistics']}
}
```

## Data Folder
- The script saves all scraped data into a folder (`master_courses_24_25` by default).
- If the data folder exists, the script will **load data from the JSON files** instead of scraping again.
- To **force re-scraping**, delete the data folder or change the name.
- The filtered courses are saved in `filtered_courses.json` by default.
